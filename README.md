# m6900-python

This is my attempt to get all my mouse's functions working in Linux, whilst getting acquainted with Python for the first time.
It currently sets the DPI value and preset. I hope to add more features to it if possible.

The mouse works with single digit numbers representing the incriment in the dpiValue variable. (e.g. 0=400dpi and 16=3200dpi).

It appears to work for my setup, but I offer no guarantees for its reliablility and safety of your mouse. Buyer beware and all that shizzle.
