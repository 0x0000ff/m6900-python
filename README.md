# m6900-python

This is my attempt to get all my mouse's functions working in Linux, whilst getting acquainted with Python for the first time.
It currently sets the DPI value and preset. I hope to add more features to it if possible.
It appears to work for my setup, but I offer no guarantees for its reliablility. Buyer beware and all that shizzle.
